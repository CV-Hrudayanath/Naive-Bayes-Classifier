# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Implementation of Naive Bayes classifier

# Datasets: 
 Two different datasets from the UCI Machine learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/),
i) Bank Marketing Dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
ii) Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)

Note:- 
 For the 1 st dataset i.e the bank dataset i have considered only the discrete/ categorial data for classification and for    the 2 nd dataset i.e cancer dataset all the feautures are continuos and i have used gaussian naive bayes approach.
